      Thompson Family Acupuncture Clinic, a local business, came to me in need of a new
      branding package. The practice was already well established in the area, but as they had grown they had also
      amassed several different branding and marketing styles. My initial goal was to capture the feel of the business
      in order to then go about creating a brand.

      Researching acupuncture was a fascinating experience for me. While I’m certainly
      still not an expert, I have experienced acupuncture several times, and I’m now familiar with several tenets of
      Chinese medicine. One of the key parts of acupuncture is an understanding of meridian lines—channels in the human
      body that, when stimulated, activate or stimulate other related areas in the body. As part of my research and
      branding efforts, I created a graphic of a person that exhibits the meridian lines.

      Another aspect of Chinese medicine that Thompson Family Acupuncture Clinic embraced well is that of natural
      treatment. Far before medication and intervention is needed, natural lifestyle changes and remedies can help
      course-correct people back to good health. Because of this, I chose to draw a correlation between the meridian
      lines of acupuncture and the natural lines occuring in nature. For this, I drew on photographs of natural
      remedies, and wove in the meridian lines.

      This was a big step in the right direction. The images played a prominent role in nutrition education pieces and
      brand displays. It also became apparent that there was a need to show the specialists in action. For this, I set
      up some photoshoots to get high-quality images of acupuncture in action. The on-brand images were perfect for
      online presence, so I created a series of Instagram and Facebook images to be used throughout the year.

      Over time, the brand settled into its sweet spot. I continue to be the supplier of graphics and brand assets for
      Thompson Family Acupuncture.
