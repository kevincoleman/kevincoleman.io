    <p class="projectDescription">
      I was approached by a photographer friend of mine recently about a new agency that
      was forming in town: <a href="http://www.wallawallaportraitdesign.com/" target="_blank">Walla Walla Portrait
        Design</a>. The agency hadn’t completely decided on their name at that point, but they knew they’d be needing a
      cohesive brand package. I met with the three main stakeholders at the time, and gathered notes about their
      vision, æsthetic, and practice. From this, I walked the stakeholders through an exercise designed to help them
      discover what aspects they valued in a brand.

    <p class="projectDescription">
      After gathering key aspects of branding design, I began sketching ideas which used the core values that had been
      communicated to me. My goal was to present several options with a low time investment in order to gather visual
      direction before creating a branding package.

    <p class="projectDescription">With options to discuss, I was able to gather group opinions and wishes in order to
      then create a vector mark. Around this vector mark I then built a small brand usage guidelines document. I also
      made myself available to them going forward, so that if they had any usage questions or special cases that needed
      design help they’d feel well-supported.</p>
