    <p class="projectDescription">In my lettering, I take inspiration from the greats. One of those greats is a
      UK-based sign maker named <a href="https://www.instagram.com/davesmithartist" target="_blank">Dave Smith</a>. His
      slow-developed
      skill for creating old-world, top-quality works astounds me, so I thought I’d try my hand. Attempting to capture
      an old-world-ephemera feel, I worked up a lettering
      illustration, then vectorized it for digital use. As most good things do, it started with a sketch. I tried to
      channel my inner Dave to make the sketch as detailed as possible.</p>

      <figcaption class="figureCaption">My initial sketch, started at a local coffee shop, and finsihed at home.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class="projectDescription">While I have not acquired the skills necessary for gold-gilding windows, this foray
      into old-style lettering was quite gratifying. The process of vectorizing the image was also fairly painstaking,
      but the ability to play with the graphic’s colors or print it in large format is certainly worth the trouble.</p>
