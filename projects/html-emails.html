    <h1 class="projectTitle">Swivel: Developing a new Remote Office Experience</h1>
    <!-- Image -->
    <p class="projectDescription">A few years back, I found myself wanting a lightweight tool that would facilitate
      office
      conversation with a low barrier to entry. My initial thought was that taking the time to call someone via Zoom or
      Hangouts
      was just too formal. Placing a call takes more effort than just speaking, and gives your coworker a chance to
      decline.
      There’s no overhearing office chatter with calls that are so planned and boring. “Wouldn’t it be great if I could
      just
      hold a keyboard shortcut and talk through my coworker’s office speakers?” I thought.

        culture.</figcaption>

    <p class="projectDescription">If we could maintain video calls for long periods of time to pair-program, why
      couldn’t
      we just always have a connection to the whole team open, awaiting a quick key-press to engage? Shoot—why couldn’t
      we
      even emulate an open floor plan where <em>the default</em> is to overhear what’s going on? I worked from coffee
      shops;
      coworking spaces; open offices. I gleaned thoughts about what it means to be present in a space:
    </p>
    <ul class="projectList">
      <li>Presence is passive</li>
      <li>Presence always implies proximity (which affects volume)</li>
      <li>Presence is observable by all parties</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      From these thoughts, I began sketching ideas for how presence, proximity, and volume might be represented
      naturally to users.
    </p>

    <p class="projectDescription">
      There were lots of things to think about in the realm of presence. Was it ok for someone to hear me if I couldn’t
      hear them?
      What about seeing someone’s video when they were talking to a group I wasn’t in? Should we use people’s locations
      to
      deduce their actual physical presence in a room? The list went on. In order to start small and fail fast, I
      crafted
      up a small component designed to represent a user’s presence.
    </p>

      <img src="../images/presence.png" alt="Thoughts about displaying presence" class="imageBanner">
    </figure>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      From there it was only natural to begin using these components in a format that seemed familiar: a chat client.
    </p>

    <p class="projectDescription">
      This immediately threw us into the deep end, as we considered how basic design principles like alignment and
      proximity might
      have implications as to the state of user presence. We began exploring positional interactions, as well as audio
      and
      video stream presentation in an internal prototype application.
    </p>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      From this, we learned several more things about how users are attached to their own sense of presence. We learned
      that people
      always wanted to be notified when someone “came near.” We learned that <a href="https://medium.com/swivel-app/uis-that-are-too-fast-4bb24b2a6935"
        target="_blank">sometimes you have to slow things down</a> to make sure users get what they expect.
    </p>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      As we iterated on our product, we found that we actually enjoyed its benefits quite handily. We decided to expand
      the UI
      to take advantage of larger screens, since we found we used the app on desktop as much as mobile.

    <p class="projectDescription">
      We even found there was a need for a <a href="https://medium.com/swivel-app/checking-your-hair-4cdde7e81540"
        target="_blank">check
        your hair interface</a>, which allowed the user to be certain of their microphone, camera, and audio states
      before
      logging in.

    <p class="projectDescription">
      After several months of prototyping, we released a beta version of Swivel. As part of our slow-release, we
      arranged a beta
      introduction presentation at a local coworking space. To test the app, we crafted a group puzzle to be solved
      using
      Swivel. As expected, we learned many valuable things, and came away with new ideas.
    </p>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      The development of Swivel continues, and I count myself lucky to have spearheaded much of its functional design
      in early
      stages. It’s continued evolving since my involement, but do take a look at its current form: <a href="https://swivel.is"
