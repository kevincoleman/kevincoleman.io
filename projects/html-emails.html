      I once worked for a stellar email marketing firm called <a href="https://premiercellar.com" target="_blank">Premier
        Cellar</a>. While there, I wore many hats to the company’s benefit. My path looked something like this:
      <ol class="flowDiagram">
        <li class="flowDiagramItem">Photo editor</li> <span>➡</span>
        <li class="flowDiagramItem">Designer</li> <span>➡</span>
        <li class="flowDiagramItem">Email Developer</li> <span>➡</span>
        <li class="flowDiagramItem">Integrations developer</li>
      </ol>

      <figcaption class="figureCaption">A few edited glam bottle shots.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      As a photo editor, I was responsible for the treatment and standardization of a large quantity of wine bottle
      glam shots. I spent time fine-tuning my graphic editing skills as well as crafting new workflow improvements to
      speed up production.
    </p>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      After organizing our bottle shot library and getting us caught up on editing, I moved into designing emails. I
      designed hundreds of custom layouts, tailoring them to the clients’ styles and particular campaigns (holiday,
      wine club, &c.). This was also an opportunity to test and learn what readers found usable, as I was able to
      analyze designs by A/B testing and seeing large-sample conversion data.
    </p>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      My next adventure in creating custom campaigns was to develop them in HTML and CSS. This was no small task. HTML
      emails play by their own set of standards—most of which are still from about 2003. Using cross-platform testing
      tools, I learned to creatively solve display issues to optimize campaign performance.

      My final role while at Premier Cellar was one of a data integrations developer. We recognized that a large
      portion of our work for each campaign was in recipient list management. In order to improve our records, I taught
      myself how to write an integration script that could regularly pull customer data from client CRMs into our email
      sending platform. This was my first big venture into server-side, API development.

      While at Premier Cellar, I learned volumes about how to introduce efficiencies into workflows. From authoring
      development snippet libraries and organizing campaign assets to educating coworkers on procedure and training
      clients, Premier Cellar gave me a chance to get my feet wet in the world of rapid development.
