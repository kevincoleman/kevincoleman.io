    <p class="projectDescription">
      A few years back I had the pleasure of working with the crew at <a href="https://k3.is/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">K3</a>
      on a project for Adventist Giving. The goal of the project was to create a site that facilitated easy donations
      from church-goers to their respective churches (or churches they visited). The target user group was all of North
      America, but the site needed to be functional world-wide.
    </p>

      <figcaption class="figureCaption">The landing page at <a href="https://adventistgiving.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">adventistgiving.org</a>.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      To build the site, we leveraged the robust architecture of Google’s Angular 2. We built the platform to handle
      payments worldwide, both directly via EFT and via Credit/Debit. We also crafted a payment method management
      system, and integrated the system into Adventist Giving’s existing internal database stuctures.
    </p>
    <p class="projectDescription">In particular, I was responsible for crafting up the UIs, including forms, donation
      pages, account management pages, login modals, and the site’s custom church-search modal. I was responsible not
      only for visual design of pages, but also for writing much of the front-end JavaScript that renders the
      application.</p>
    <figure class="figure figureLeft">
      <img src="../images/adventistGiving-auth.jpg" alt="Donation Envelope website layout" class="figureImage">
      <figcaption class="figureCaption">We crafted a unique auth security model.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      We overcame some very interesting, real-world restrictions pertaining to authentication and security in an
      open-API environment. We wrestled as a team to strike the right balance between convenience and security, erring
      on the security side.
    </p>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      As part of our construction of the site, we were also trusted as the owners of the public API, which allowed
      other developers to build native apps against the same database interface. They also used our authentication
      system, so we got plenty of time collaborating with outside teams. I personally documented large portions of the
      API by testing endpoints and writing spec.
    </p>
    <p class="projectDescription">
      As a finishing touch, I took the opportunity to provide Adventist Giving with a new logo (they previously had no
      brand mark—only text). The spot on the hand holds double meaning, representing both Christ’s nail-pierced hand,
      and the widow giving her last coin—both signs of great sacrifice.
