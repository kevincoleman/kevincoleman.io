  Short description
    I’m a classically trainer designer-turned-developer with a passion for helping working teams transform into family. I’ve worked in corporate marketing, small-firm start-ups, and even in client relations with Google. I believe the best places are the ones where people come first. I love using insightful, proactive communication to be a peacemaker when it’s needed most. One of my favorite things is watching the light go on when something clicks for the first time.
